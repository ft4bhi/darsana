Controller of exams mentioned that the way we have conducted the seminar proves beyond doubt that we are "up to doing something concrete.” </p>
                    <p className="[margin-block-start:0] [margin-block-end:1px]">A follow-up council with about 90 members with representation from all 18 colleges was constituted.
