                        Educational support program at Sholayur tribal higher secondary
                        school, Attappady Darsana intervenes to provide constructive and
                        qualitative educational support programs that address the issues of
                        backwardness in the area of education in Kerala, particularly in the
                        tribal regions of the state due to socio-economic reasons. To this
                        end, Darsana began studying and understanding the problem of learning
                        difficulties among students in the students in the tribal regions in
                        the state. We started with a tribal school in Attappady; The Govt.
                        tribal higher secondary school, Sholayur. Through various interactions
                        with teachers, students, and the local community, Darsana formulated
                        actionable plans for educational interventions in 2019, partnering
                        with other educational experts to ensure the quality of the
                        interventions. The key objectives of these interventions were:
                    </p>
                    <p className="mt-0 mb-1">
                        1. Identify specific programs that address the learning problems of
                        tribal students caused by language conflicts.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mt-0 mb-1">
                        2. Support the school with materials and training to implement the
                        identified programs.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mt-0 mb-1">
                        3. Plan or join various programs for supporting the students from
                        tribal communities to reach the mainstream with pride and dignity,
                        without leaving their language and culture, but by protecting and
                        enriching those values.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mt-0 mb-1">
                        The first issue we addressed was the medium of instruction in the
                        classrooms of standards I to VII.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mt-0 mb-1">
                        The textbooks, teaching, and examinations are in Malayalam, which is
                        not the student's mother tongue, Irula, a scriptless language.
                        Children often face difficulty in understanding concepts and achieving
                        their learning outcomes. To support the students to overcome this
                        obstacle in learning, it was necessary to transform the learning
                        environment into something more motivating and encouraging. This
                        program included adding accessible reading materials, digital reading
                        materials and activities, and other learning aids for the students, as
                        well as multiple workshops for the teachers to integrate these
                        materials into their teaching process.

                    <p className="mt-0 mb-1">
                        1. Darsana installed classroom libraries in all primary-level
                        classrooms with carefully selected reading materials in Malayalam and
                        English.

                    <p className="mt-0 mb-1">
                        2. Darsana conducted multiple training workshops for teachers and
                        students to design integrated learning activities to boost confidence
                        and overcome the language barrier.

                    <p className="m-0">
                        3. Darsana also delivered multifunctional cubes for various activities
                        of students from classes I to VII. A full-day workshop was also
                        conducted to demonstrate various possibilities with the cubes, such as
                        fun games, math activities, seating, and performance activities.
