          The seminar we conducted at Palakkad Fort Palace was a roaring
          success.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Participants from 15 colleges out of the 18 colleges under the
          University of Calicut attended. Parents, University staff members,
          students from many colleges, teachers from almost all colleges, and
          the controller of exams were all present at the function. The total
          number of participants was 118. The seminar maintained the schedule
          and the discussions were all to the point. Eminent personalities from
          IIT Madras, NIT Calicut, Anna University, Amrita University (deemed),
          etc. were present. Principals of 6 engineering colleges attended and
          expressed their views. Members from the media fraternity, who visited,
          appreciated the seriousness of the seminar.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The &quot;Open House &quot; was vibrant with divergent views and
          effective inputs from all sections of the participants. The controller
          of exams mentioned that the way we have conducted the seminar proves
          beyond doubt that we are &quot;up to doing something concrete.&quot; A
          follow-up council with about 90 members with representation from all
          18 colleges was constituted. A 14-member executive committee was
          formed to spearhead the activities of the council. Mr. Sreenadhan is
          the convener of the EC, and four Darsana members are also part of the
          executive committee.

        <p>
          Darsana has established itself as a renowned name in all the
          Engineering colleges under the University of Calicut, and also among
          the &quot;who is who&quot; at the University of Calicut and some other
          major universities.
