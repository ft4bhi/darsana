                        We were at the forefront of helping Covid affected people in the
                        middle east region. We coordinated financial and repatriation support
                        for the affected people, including sponsoring a repatriation flight in
                        coordination with progressive alumni of other Engineering colleges in
                        Kerala.

                        Darsana was also involved in the support of affected people in Kerala.
                        This included the distribution of food kits, PPE kits, financial
                        support, etc

                        We were also involved in the development of a low-cost ventilator with
                        the technical support of the National Institute of Electronics and
                        Information Technology (NIELIT), Calicut. This ventilator is now under
                        field testing at Government Medical College, Kozhikode. We hope to be
                        able to provide affordable ventilator care.
