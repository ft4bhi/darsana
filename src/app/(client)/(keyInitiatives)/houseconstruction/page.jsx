            Bridge is a program designed to offer academic support to students
            from socially underprivileged groups in society. A large number of
            such students in professional colleges either drop out or fail to meet
            the requirements of successful completion of the courses. For example,
            the pass percentage of SC/ST students in engineering is less than 10%.
            While the main reason is the lack of an academic foundation, 
            sometimes the inability to adjust culturally to the college
            environment also contributes.

            Based on the feedback from the college, the scope of the program was
            widened to include financially weaker students along with students
            from socially underprivileged groups. Selection of the students was
            based on their family income, rank in entrance examinations, social
            category, etc. In addition to academic support, the program also
            included training on social and cultural adjustments, communication,
            and other soft skills.

            The initial plan was to start the programs for 2021-22 admissions in
            the college. However, based on the request from the college, the first
            Bridge program started with third-semester students entering the
            campus for the first time after the pandemic. Forty students were
            shortlisted for the program from a list of 500.

            The program was inaugurated by Principal Dr P. R. Suresh on December
            18, 2021. The nodal officer from the college Dr.Harikrishnan and a few
            members from Darsana also were present. The program started with
            Mathematics and English/Personality development classes.

            Subsequently, another batch for fresh 2021 admissions also was

            are participating in it.
