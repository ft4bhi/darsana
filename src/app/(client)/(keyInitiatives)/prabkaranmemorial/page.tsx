                    The presentation included about 5 power point slides, a high level summary of the project and the current progress. These were reviewed by 9 judges. All from UAE members. The judges provided their feedback and sometimes discussed with the students about the prospects and scopes for improvements. Coordinator Dr. Sajeesh provided all required coordinations with the student teams.

                <p className="mb-4">
                    A Jotform was shared to the judges. Judges marked their marks instantly in the online form upon completion of the presentations. This process took about a minute only. Committee plans to implement the same during the final evaluation. This will help to announce the winner faster.
